Welcome to my portfolio! This repository serves as a way for those interested to take a look at some of my work.

Currently, the portfolio has the following:

BIOL 495: Data Science for Biologists (Purdue University) Final Project
-
  BIOL 495 Course Description: All of us are drawn to real-world biological questions. Nevertheless, we might underestimate the hidden demand for computing skills to   conduct the actual research. By nature, biological data is versatile, vast, complex, and noisy. Therefore, customized scripts are often needed for data processing,   analyses, and visualization. Tools for data management and version control function as virtual lab books to ensure that the studies are 100% reproducible. This       course is designed to equip students with practical programming skills via an array of biological case studies. Through hands-on computer labs, students will learn   how to translate a biological question into logical thinking and write good code in python and R, perform scientific computing and visualization in R, and manage     projects in an organized fashion.

  This final project is centered around a dataset collected based on a study of fish in the Konza Prarie, MO published from Kansas State University. The project
  expected students to take a provided dataset and manipulate it based on a scientific question, followed by a full length discussion as to what the data
  represented. A project report (Created in R markdown) has been provided in addition to the R script.
